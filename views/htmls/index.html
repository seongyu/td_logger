                                This paper should be considered in the context of modern avalanche statistics. Recent reports show that complex “special case” multiple burials requiring special techniques (or technology) are extremely rare.2 The issues addressed in this paper apply only to the limited number of professionals who are qualified to use such techniques and technologies in the field. Recreationists should be taught to master basic single search techniques, efficient shoveling, and how to organize a rescue before learning specialized techniques and technologies for complex multiple burials.

                                    Pulse rate standard: The European standard for avalanche beacons, EN 300- 718, requires that all avalanche transceivers have a pulse period from 0.7 to 1.3 seconds (700 to 1,300 milliseconds). The pulse width is allowed to be from .07 to 0.9 seconds (70 to 900 milliseconds).

                                To study the issue of signal overlap, it is first important to define several concepts inherent to transceivers, which are shown in Figure 1.
                                Signal amplitude: The strength of a signal, measured in volts. In oscilloscope images, this is the height of the signal above ground (or zero amplitude value).

                        </div>
                        <div class="row">

                                <h2>

                                </h2>
                                <p>
                                    For best results, the timing analysis integrates many pulses, not just one. The longer this sample is taken, the more accurate the timing analysis will be. However, this requires more processing power and can create “delayed display,” or slow response to changes in distance and direction–even if searching for only one victim.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The benefit of signal timing analysis is that once a transmitter is clearly identified by its pulse rate, it can be “marked,” or cancelled after it is found. Then the searcher can move on to the next signal without performing the Three Circle Method, Micro Search Strip Method or Special Mode. While this sounds quite simple and can work well under ideal conditions, it breaks down when the victims’ transmit pulses happen to be on at the same time. This is commonly referred to as “signal overlap.”

                                    systems also attempt to identify each beacon based on the small differences between the various transmitter frequencies.
